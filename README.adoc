== Instructions

===  1.- Select all the actors with the first name ‘Scarlett’.
`Answer:`
```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  actor
WHERE
  first_name = 'Scarlett';
```

=== 2.- Select all the actors with the last name ‘Johansson’.
`Answer:`
```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  actor
WHERE
  last_name = ('Johansson');
```

=== 3.- How many films (movies) are available for rent?
`Answer:`
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) film_id
FROM
  inventory;
```

=== 4.- How many films have been rented?
`Answer:`
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) rental_id
FROM
  rental;
```

=== 5.- What is the shortest and longest rental period?
`Answer:`
```sql
SELECT
  MIN(rental_duration),
  MAX(rental_duration)
FROM
  film;
```
`also this can be expressed like so:`
```sql
SELECT
  MAX (
    DATEDIFF (rental.return_date, rental.rental_date)
  ) AS longest_rental_period,
  (
    DATEDIFF (rental.return_date, rental.rental_date)
  ) > (0) AS shortest_rental_period
FROM
  rental;
```

=== 6.- What are the shortest and longest movie duration? Name the values `max_duration` and `min_duration`.
`Answer:`
```sql
SELECT
  MIN(length) AS min_duration,
  MAX(length) AS max_duration
FROM
  film;
```

=== 7.- What's the average movie duration?
`Answer:`
```sql
SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(length)) AS average_movie_duration
FROM
  film;
```

=== 8.- What's the average movie duration expressed in format (hours, minutes)?
`Answer:`
*Using the FLOOR() and MOD function*

 We have to round the operation first otherwise will give 55m,127 like so:
 select `CONCAT(FLOOR((avg(length))/60),'h ',MOD((avg(length)),60),'m')` from film;
```sql
SELECT
  CONCAT(
    FLOOR(ROUND((AVG(length))) / 60),
    'h ',
    MOD(ROUND((AVG(length))), 60),
    'm'
  ) AS average_movie_duration
FROM
  film;
```

=== 9.- How many movies longer than 3 hours?
`Answer:`
```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT COUNT(length) AS movies_longer_than_3h
FROM
  film
WHERE
  length > (3 * 60);
```

=== 10.- Get the name and email formatted. Example: Mary SMITH - mary.smith@sakilacustomer.org.
`Answer:`
```sql
SELECT
  concat(first_name, ' ', last_name, ' ', '-', ' ', email) AS customer_contact_info
FROM
  customer;
```

=== 11.- What's the length of the longest film title?
`Answer:`
```sql
SELECT
  MAX(length(title)) AS longest_film_title
FROM
  film;
```
